Boeing 707-320B Advanced ands 707-320C
======================================

This is a model of the Boeing 707-320B Advanced or 707-320C. It is based
on the 707 model made by Marc Kraus, who improved the original model, created
by Innis Cunningham, by adding new instruments, textures, and a JSBSim FDM.
The original Bendix PB-20 autopilot was written by Markus Bulik.

The model on which it is based uses the wing from the 707-320B Advanced or
707-320C, but used the Pratt and Whitney JT4A or Rolls-Royce Conway 508 from
the 707-320 aircraft, which is incorrect. Both engines have been removed
and replaced with the Pratt and Whitney JT3D-3 engine.
