Startup engines:
follow the tutorials or use Autostart

Quick startup engines:
Switch GRD START at the Overhead Panel to HIGH PRESS

Shutdown engines:

or cutoff levers down

WARNING: Control the air compressors in the engineer panel.
You need them for Anti-Ice System and Pressurization.
Often they fall back at startup procedure or
to high airspeed. Also if engines goes down by fire or no fuel.
Restart them and wait that all control lamps extinguished.
If air compressor won't work, open BLEED AIR valves
on ENG 2, 3 and 4. This can replace one air compressor.

_______________________________________________________
The first 707 for Flightgear was created by Innis Cunningham.
This version is a revamp of that original. Nearly
everthing in the 3D models is written and painted new.
Also the JSBSim FDM and the autopilot are new.
For development I have used the BOEING 707 document
no. D6-3071-00
